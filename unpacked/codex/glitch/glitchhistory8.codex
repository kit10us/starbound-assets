  "Glitch reproduction is managed by couples, and seems to be one of the Glitch's many programmed blind spots.

It was some time before I was able to witness the process, as Glitch who would allow me to observe the procedure were few and far between. When I eventually did find a willing couple, what I saw was quite fascinating.

Parts were procured from a certain shop, the couple picking items and features that \"felt right\".",

"These parts were then taken home and, over the course of several weeks, the new Glitch was built.

The process took place over multiple sessions, and was always undertaken in private (but for my presence).

Each time, once the work had started in earnest, both Glitch went into a sort of trance - some level of their functioning entirely suspended.",

"While in this state they carried out feats of engineering I would usually deem far beyond them - these being enacted mechanically, efficiently, and completely silently.

It was quite strange to watch. At the terminus of each session the two Glitch would suddenly and simultaneously become their usual selves. Interestingly, the few times I tried to discuss the process after the fact, neither would go beyond stating that \"They had a very nice time\"."
