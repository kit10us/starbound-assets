    "I'd met a Frogg merchant who'd set up shop on the Outpost selling furniture, he'd told me to come back to him if I ever wanted to try my hand at intergalactic real estate. So I planted a flag and hopped over there in my ship to see him. 

He sold me a \"Colony Deed\" and told me to place it on the wall. Provided the house was well lit, furnished and structurally sound, an ad would be sent out and a suitable tenant would immediately take up residence.",

"I was sceptical at first, but sure enough after filling the shack with furniture I'd looted from a Floran village (what can I say, I'm a sucker for the sticks 'n' bones aesthetic) I placed the deed on the wall and a complete stranger beamed right to where I was standing. 

And so began my long and arduous relationship with the Floran known as Ambiri."
