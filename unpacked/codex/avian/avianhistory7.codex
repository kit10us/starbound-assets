    "Like most Avians I was not born on Avos, but grew up surrounded by tales of our homeworld. For as long as I could remember I dreamed that I would one day travel there. It took many years of hard work and discipline to afford the trip, a crucial part of an Avian's pilgrimage.

Finally I made the long journey, and I was truly rewarded. The beauty of Avos is unrivalled in this universe, as Avos once dwelt in the Aether within the wings of Kluex."
