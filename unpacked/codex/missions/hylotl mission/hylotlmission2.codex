    "We have had word - they are going to sink the Library. And so this temple of knowledge slips further into the shadow that has darkened our great civilisation. Soon, like all else, it will rest beneath the waves.

Construction has already begun, the structure is almost viable already. I fear what the humidity will do to the older volumes... but better the damp than the Floran. They have destroyed everything else, they must not get the books too."
