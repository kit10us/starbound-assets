    "The Baron (Glitch): living but retired.

The Baron's exploits span several decades and hundreds of worlds. He has fought swarms of Ignome in the Magma fields of Apoc, and plundered treasure from the ruins of once great civilisations. He has sailed the savage seas of Cyanine, and explored the darkest depths of the remote Ereb Forest; in all these endeavours always pursued by his arch-nemesis Count 01, the ancient and powerful RAMpire. Truly, The Baron is one of history's greatest adventurers."
