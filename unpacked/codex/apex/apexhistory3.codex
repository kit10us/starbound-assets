    "Trial #5062: Observations

Theta branch sent over their new batch of gene re-sequence strings, so we eagerly put them to the test on subject #5062.

We were hoping that the new Proto-Ray level adjustments we made after Trials #5032-5039 might yield improved results, but #5062 unfortunately expired 002:000 metaclicks into the process, suffering from surprising cranial displacement. Fascinating to observe.",
"Trial #5062: Conclusions

Proto-Ray levels incompatible with new gene resequence strings. I advise to start with lower Proto-Ray levels and note any improvement.",

"Trial #5063: Observations

We tried the process again with lower Proto-Ray levels as advised. Subject initially appeared to respond well. Further observation revealed a sudden drop in mental activity and motor skills, but with a newfound compulsion to make loud chirping noises.

Subject was forcefully terminated at 055:106 metaclicks, after being deemed too irritating to maintain alive.",

"Trial #5063: Conclusions

Out of curiosity, I investigated the gene strings we were given. May I request Theta branch stop attempting to save time by splicing gene samples from their pet weasels, it is causing us a great deal of wasted time and effort."
