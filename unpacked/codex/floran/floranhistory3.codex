    "To the people of my birth tribe,

Can you not see the horrors inflicted by our kind upon the people of the universe? Once we gained access to space travel we spread across the stars like weeds.

It breaks my heart to see Floran colonies leaving only chaos and destruction in their wake. But we each have a choice, we don't have to live to hunt, we can even learn to talk without hissing!",

"I know you all hate me for leaving, but it is possible to forge your own path!

If you are able to read this, please consider it!"
