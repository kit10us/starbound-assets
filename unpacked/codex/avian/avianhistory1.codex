    "Avos was once tethered beyond the stars - This much is known.

There was no beginning, for the Avian kind have lived eternally beyond the mortal realm.

In the Aether they dwelt within the embrace of Kluex, the winged one above all.

Kluex gifted them with true wings, and they worshipped in kind."
