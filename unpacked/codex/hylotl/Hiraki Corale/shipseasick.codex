    "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl adventurer

I've spent my days on this ship feeling exceptionally queasy, on occasion I have actually succumbed to the nausea and... Well, it is not polite to speak of it.

Right now, I'm looking for a sidekick. And a plan! And a cause, maybe. I hear those Apex could use a little help. Or maybe the humans. I will crusade for justice throughout the galaxy, and it will be glorious."
