Let it never be said that I do not attempt to integrate with whichever hosts I find myself indebted to. I have noticed that when addressing me, the Glitch use prefix words. Examples: \"Dismissive\", \"Annoyed\", \"Alarmed\" and \"Frustrated\". Feeling as if this is a custom I should practice, I have begun to partake in such linguistic frippery myself.",

"\"Delighted. It is good to see you.\" I said, but the Glitch I was addressing simply gave me a strange look, and then said something to his friend. Perhaps this was a faux pas on my account?"
