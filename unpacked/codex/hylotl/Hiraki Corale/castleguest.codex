    "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer

The hospitality of the Glitch is indisputable. When we met, they found me scaling the castle wall, attempting to have a look through a tower window; they politely invited me inside. Now, of course it sounded like a trap, so there was a bit of a scuffle at first, but it turned out they were genuine.",

"They offered me the run of the castle, to explore, research and investigate to my heart's content. Occasionally I run into one of them and they greet me pleasantly enough. I have been reading all manner of fascinating books, and my understanding of the Glitch is growing."
