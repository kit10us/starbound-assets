    "Ship is prepped, I hear it humming,
Pulse is pounding, heart is thrumming.
Miniknog guards are close behind,
Fear and panic floods my mind.
Light glows green, I waste no time-
punch the throttle, do the crime.
Neon signs are rushing past:
\"Obey Big Ape or be Outcast!\"
I know I never can return,
But as the warp drive starts to burn
I vow to set my people free
From their life of slavery.
I cannot leave them behind bars
While I am free, bound for the stars."
