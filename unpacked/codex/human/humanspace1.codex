  "^yellow;//OVERVIEW^white;

The ^orange;Universal Space Corporate Military^white; has faced a taxing fiscal cycle. Our goal - to spread the force and influence of humanity beyond Earth - remains in sight as always. 

The Terrene Protectorate still denotes us as a rogue footnote in Earth's history, but we are confident that their insistent inaction leaves them vulnerable. We shall not make the same mistakes as our cousins on Earth.",

"^yellow;//EMPLOYMENT^white;

In previous cycles, our private prison project has shown to increase overall staff compliancy. However, the last six terms have been tough on our Merchant-class freighters, which has lead to an increase in staff confined to on-world imprisonment. 

Future projections show that the prisons, if left understaffed, risk each developing their own internal power hierarchies. Further observation is advised.",

"^yellow;//PROJECTS^white;

Our current financial future may seem uncertain to many, but breakthroughs in our genetic manipulation labs - with help from our allies in the Miniknog - might give us a strong foundation in the field of bioweaponry. 

Research into ^orange;Project: PARASPRITE^white; is being conducted simultaneously across many of our Research-class Freighters. Perhaps next cycle will be the start of a new future for the USCM!"
