    "Dear valued citizen,

Thank you for your patience, we are receiving an exceptionally high number of emails at this time. I can reassure you that our donor selection system uses the most reliable Apex technology to randomly select donors from all corners of our beloved society. It is with pride that I can announce our 3,215th donor is you! Congratulations! A welcome party has been despatched for your immediate initiation into the De-Ape programme. Big Ape is watching you.",

    "// To whom it may concern,

There is a rumour among Apex aristocratic circles that your so called 'donor' selection system is heavily biased towards the poorest Apex citizens. As a council official myself I am investigating the matter personally. Please direct me to the appropriate contact at the Miniknog Ministry as I have only been able to find this generic FAQ contact.

Yours sincerely, Councilman Rozabella Novich."
