    "by Hiraki Corale, Hylotl Adventurer

As one of my frequent attempts at cultural sensitivity, I decided to try and further integrate myself with my hosts. While exploring the castle, I found a number of decorative suits of armour that appear to depict great Glitch warriors. Naturally, to make my companions comfortable, I put a suit on.",

    "The armour was hard to walk in, so I lost my balance a few times. In fact, I came tumbling down the stairs and rolled into the main hall, and all Glitch eyes were on me. Rather than the warm greeting I deserved, however, they began to wail and yell. I heard the words \"Anger\" and \"Disgust\" a number of times. And then they began to chase me."
