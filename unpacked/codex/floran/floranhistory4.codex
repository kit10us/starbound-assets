    "Having been a Greenfinger for many years I can attest that good behaviour is key to the survival of a Floran tribe. First and foremost, I would advise discouraging any cannibalistic tendencies, which most often arise during funeral rituals.

This tradition is giving Floran a bad name amongst the other peoples of the universe.

Also, try to not fight with other tribes.",

"I'm sure it might feel like a good idea, but our best chance is for Floran to unite against the external forces that threaten us from beyond the stars.

Encourage your Floran kin to focus their energy into growing the size of the tribe, for there is safety in numbers!"
