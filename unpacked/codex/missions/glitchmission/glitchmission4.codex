    "Dear Baron,

I kindly (and for the FINAL TIME) request that you stop proposing legislative edicts. Additionally, I would once again like to make it clear that you are ENTIRELY UNABLE to pass laws.

To re-state - YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITATIVE POWER. Please, please stop.

Sincerely,
Lord President of the Privy Council"
