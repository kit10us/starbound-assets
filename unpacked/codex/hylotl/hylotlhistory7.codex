    "The Hylotl race has sometimes been accused of homogeny, as if in lacking a significant counter-culture we are somehow deficient. To these accusers I say, \"Observe the devout Avian and his Grounded brother; regard the rebel Apex as he encounters a Miniknog official.\"

Our culture is vivid, our thinking enlightened; we lack nothing but hostility. In truth, this congenial tranquillity is our greatest strength."
