    "It's the biggest Ixodoom I've ever seen, sheathed in sheets of bone as thick as tree trunk.

Kish and I were deep in the mountain by the time we found it, hidden in the darkness. It must be 200 years old if it's a day.

Kish is sure it's about to reproduce. I've no reason to doubt it - it's certainly mature enough, and Kish is the authority on Ixodoom.",

    "It's going to take a team of 20 to bring it in safely. I've already spoken to Maper, who thinks it's doable - though Maper is always pretty optimistic...

I'll take all the Wranglers to its nest tomorrow. We've got two days to get it to the Ceremonial Hunting Caverns before it starts to spawn."
