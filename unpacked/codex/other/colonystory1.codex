    "Last summer was one of the wettest I'd seen in the Rana Esker VI forest region. I only came out there for coffee (gotta have them fresh forest beans), and after one too many snaunts in the pouring rain I was ready to go back to bed. I could see a small dilapidated shack on the hilltop, so I began to trudge up there. It wasn't so bad when I reached it, there was even a sleeping bag and the remnants of an old campfire, obviously a popular spot for soggy, exhausted adventurers such as myself."
