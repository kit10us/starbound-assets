    "The Hunt was first established long ago by a Greenfinger called Idamta.

Idamta created The Hunt as a test of determination, prowess, and skill; a great trial in which the Floran could compete to prove themselves the most powerful and mighty hunter.

And, legend has it, as a way of \"stopping them bickering about who's the best\"."
