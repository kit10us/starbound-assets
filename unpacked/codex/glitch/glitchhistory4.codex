    "^orange;HEAR YE, CITIZENS OF THE VILLAGE!^white;

This is a decree from your beloved Mayor. There is a spreading madness among the populace - Some of our brothers and sisters speak of a \"truth\" - that they have been awakened and that the rest of us are living in some sort of \"simulation\".

This is no doubt a plague, and those struck with madness should be avoided for one's own sake."
